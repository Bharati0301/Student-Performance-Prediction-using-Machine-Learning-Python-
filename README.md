# Student-Performance-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Python-
“Machine Learning project predicting student exam performance using regression and ensemble models.”
This project predicts students’ academic performance (Math score) based on various socio-economic and academic factors using "Machine Learning algorithms in Python".  
It demonstrates a complete ML workflow — from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model.
Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze student data and explore correlations between features and exam performance.
- Build a regression model that can accurately predict a student's score.
- Evaluate model accuracy and performance metrics (MAE, R² Score).
- Save the final trained model for future use.
